    And Select plugin: "BigQuery" from the plugins list as: "Source"
    And Navigate to the properties page of plugin: "BigQuery"
    And Configure BigQuery sink plugin for Dataset and Table
    Then Validate "BigQuery" plugin properties
    And Close the Plugin Properties page
    And Select Sink plugin: "SalesforceDataExtension" from the plugins list
    And Connect source as "BigQuery" and sink as "Salesforce Marketing" to establish connection
    And Navigate to the properties page of plugin: "Salesforce Marketing"
    And Enter input plugin property: "referenceName" with value: "Referencename"
    And Click on the Macro button of Property: "dataExtension" and set the value to: "dataExtension"
    And Select radio button plugin property: "operation" with value: "<OperationType>"
    And Click on the Macro button of Property: "clientId" and set the value to: "clientId"
    And Click on the Macro button of Property: "clientSecret" and set the value to: "clientSecret"
    And Click on the Macro button of Property: "authEndpoint" and set the value to: "authEndpoint"

    And Enter runtime argument value from environment variable "admin.base.uri" for key "authEndpoint"
    And Enter runtime argument value from environment variable "admin.soap.endpoint" for key "soapEndpoint"
    And Run the preview of pipeline with runtime arguments
    And Verify the preview of pipeline is "successfully"
    Examples:
      | OperationType |
      | INSERT        |
      | UPDATE        |
      | UPSERT        |
